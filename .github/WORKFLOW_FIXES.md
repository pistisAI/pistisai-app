# GitHub Workflow Fixes for Web Deployment

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Silent Build Failures**
- Added `BUILD_SHA` build argument to web image build
- Added verification step to check if Docker images were built successfully
- Added error handling to catch empty image tags

### 2. **Web Image Testing**
- Added local Docker image test before pushing to registry
- Tests health endpoint (`/health`)
- Tests index.html contains Flutter content
- Tests main.dart.js exists and is accessible
- Provides detailed error messages if any test fails

### 3. **Dockerfile Improvements**
- Added verbose logging to Flutter build process
- Added verification that `index.html` exists after build
- Added directory listing to help diagnose missing files
- Better error messages if build fails

### 4. **Deployment Verification**
- Enhanced rollout status checking with pod inspection
- Added web pod logs retrieval for debugging
- Added deployment description output
- Better error messages for deployment failures

### 5. **Nginx Configuration**
- Added `/debug/assets` endpoint for asset inspection
- Improved health check endpoint
- Better MIME type handling for WebAssembly and ES modules

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Trigger a deployment** by pushing to main branch
2. **Check the workflow logs** for:
   - "Web image test passed" message
   - Docker image tags in verification step
   - Pod status and logs in deployment verification

3. **Test the deployed app**:
   ```bash
   curl https://app.pistisai.app/health
   curl https://app.pistisai.app/debug/assets
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "main.dart.js not found"
- **Cause**: Flutter build failed silently
- **Solution**: Check Docker build logs for Flutter errors
- **Fix**: Dockerfile now shows build output and verifies files exist

### Issue: "index.html missing or invalid"
- **Cause**: Build artifacts not copied correctly
- **Solution**: Verify build/web directory exists in builder stage
- **Fix**: Added verification step in Dockerfile

### Issue: "Health endpoint failed"
- **Cause**: Nginx not running or misconfigured
- **Solution**: Check nginx configuration and container logs
- **Fix**: Added pod logs retrieval in deployment verification

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the next deployment for any issues
2. Check the workflow logs for detailed build output
3. If issues persist, check:
   - Flutter version compatibility
   - Dart SDK version
   - Available disk space in Docker builder
   - Memory constraints during build
