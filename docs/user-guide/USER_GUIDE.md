# Pistisai User Guide

Pistisai is a privacy-first companion shell for Hermes, OpenClaw, and compatible private agent runtimes. It gives the selected agent runtime a secure channel to you, plus controlled access to desktop, vision, voice, avatar, and multi-device sync features.

The setup wizard decides which agent runtime and device path to use. There is no universal default runtime. Hermes is the first agent runtime path used for current testing, while OpenClaw remains a supported agent runtime and the original integration target.

Ollama, LM Studio, and similar local model servers are optional support model providers. They can help with memory, embeddings, summarization, classification, OCR cleanup, and speech helpers, but they are not the main agent endpoint.

---

## Overview

Pistisai is organized around seven core pillars:

1. **Secure Agent Channel** - The main window is a direct, low-friction channel to the selected agent runtime.
2. **Avatar And Voice Companion** - A sidecar companion window for avatar presence and voice interaction.
3. **Desktop Control** - Permissioned hands-on access to the current desktop.
4. **Vision** - Screen, region, OCR, and camera understanding.
5. **Agent Runtime Management** - Runtime discovery, health, tools, sessions, and agent lifecycle.
6. **Local Intelligence Support** - Optional local model providers for app-owned memory and background features.
7. **Secure Device Mesh** - Tailscale-first connectivity and optional cloud sync across your devices.

Agent management is still available, but it is not the first thing in the interface. The first screen should feel like a secure conversation path to the active agent runtime.

## Getting Started

### First Run

When you first launch Pistisai, the setup wizard guides you through the decisions that matter:

1. **Choose an agent runtime**
   - Hermes on this machine or another device
   - OpenClaw Gateway
   - Compatible custom agent gateway
   - Optional Pistisai-hosted agent runtime

2. **Choose where the agent runtime lives**
   - This computer
   - Another device on your Tailscale tailnet
   - A private server or VPS in your tailnet
   - Optional Pistisai-hosted agent runtime container

3. **Test the agent connection**
   - The wizard checks health, sessions, tools, streaming, and exposed capabilities.
   - Hermes is the first agent runtime path to validate during current testing.

4. **Optionally configure local model support**
   - Ollama, LM Studio, or a custom local model endpoint can support memory and background intelligence.
   - These providers do not become the main agent endpoint.

5. **Set desktop permissions**
   - Desktop control, clipboard, file actions, vision, and command execution are enabled per device.
   - Remote devices cannot receive desktop actions unless that device grants them.

6. **Enable optional sync**
   - Conversation state and presence can sync between installed devices.
   - Local desktop permissions and action approvals remain device-scoped.

### Agent Runtime Discovery

The app can discover or configure agent runtimes:

| Runtime | Typical Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hermes | Configured by wizard | First agent runtime path for current testing |
| OpenClaw Gateway | `localhost:18789` | Supported original integration |
| Custom agent gateway | User supplied | Private compatible agent runtime |
| Hosted agent runtime | Pistisai managed | Optional paid compute |

### Support Model Discovery

Optional local model providers are configured separately:

| Provider | Typical Endpoint | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LM Studio | `localhost:1234` | Local model support for app features |
| Ollama | `localhost:11434` | Local model support for memory/background features |
| Custom model endpoint | User supplied | Local support model provider |

---

## Secure Agent Channel

The main app window is the direct channel to the selected agent runtime.

### Chat Features

- Streaming responses
- Conversation history
- Agent session selection when the runtime exposes sessions
- Model selection only when exposed by the active agent runtime
- Search across conversations
- Import and export
- Runtime status and connection health

### Runtime Switching

Agent runtime management lives behind settings, setup, and management views. Use it to:

- Add or remove agent runtime endpoints
- Test health and streaming
- Inspect active agent sessions
- Review available tools and capabilities
- Configure optional local model providers for app support features

---

## Avatar And Voice Companion

The avatar and voice companion are one feature surface. The companion can appear as a sidecar or pop-out window, so it can stay open beside the main app or another desktop workflow.

### Companion Features

- Avatar state: idle, listening, thinking, speaking, working, error
- Voice conversation mode
- Push-to-talk and planned wake/listening flows
- Text-to-speech through the selected agent runtime or Pistisai fallback services
- Personality, memory, and evolution features as they mature

The companion should not replace the main secure channel. It provides presence, voice, and side conversation while the main window remains focused on the active agent runtime conversation.

---

## Desktop Control

Desktop control is a core feature. It gives the selected agent runtime controlled hands-on capability on the current device.

### Capabilities

- Screenshot capture
- Region capture
- Vision analysis
- Click, type, and keyboard actions
- Clipboard actions
- Window management
- System notifications
- Command execution when explicitly enabled

### Safety Model

- Desktop actions are local to the device granting permission.
- The agent runtime can request actions; the local app approves, executes, and audits them.
- Visual indicators show when automation or capture is active.
- Sensitive actions should require explicit user approval.
- Action history should be reviewable.
- Cloud sync does not imply permission to control every synced device.
- Local model providers never receive desktop-control authority.

---

## Vision

Vision features let the active agent runtime understand what is on the current device.

- Full-screen capture
- Region capture
- OCR and text extraction
- Camera input where supported
- Continuous watch modes for selected regions

Vision permissions are per device and should be visible while active.

---

## Secure Device Mesh

Pistisai is designed to be installed on all your devices and kept in sync.

Tailscale is the preferred secure transport. Instead of maintaining a separate custom tunnel stack as the main path, Pistisai should use the user's tailnet wherever possible.

### Typical Layouts

- Laptop app connects to Hermes running on the same laptop.
- Desktop app connects to Hermes or OpenClaw running on a workstation in the same tailnet.
- Phone or web session connects through a per-user cloud connector that has joined the user's tailnet.
- Optional paid hosted agent runtime runs in an isolated per-user container and joins the user's tailnet only after setup approval.
- Optional Ollama/LM Studio support model providers run on local hardware for memory/background features.

### What Syncs

- Conversation state
- Agent runtime presence
- Device availability
- Avatar state and preferences
- Non-sensitive settings selected for sync

### What Stays Device-Scoped

- Desktop control permissions
- Clipboard access
- File access
- Screen and camera capture
- Shell command permissions
- Runtime secrets and local tokens unless explicitly stored in an approved secure vault

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Agent Runtime Not Found

- Confirm the agent runtime is running.
- Check the endpoint and port in runtime settings.
- Use the setup wizard connection test.
- For remote devices, check that both devices are on the expected Tailscale tailnet.
- Do not use raw Ollama or LM Studio endpoints as the agent runtime.

### Connection Lost

- Check agent runtime health.
- Verify Tailscale status for remote agent runtime paths.
- Re-run the wizard connection test.
- Switch to another configured agent runtime if available.

### Desktop Control Not Working

- Confirm desktop permissions were granted on that specific device.
- Check platform support for the requested action.
- Verify that the desktop control service is running.
- Review action approvals and denied permissions.

### Voice Companion Not Working

- Confirm the companion window is open.
- Check microphone permission where voice input is enabled.
- Verify that the agent runtime or fallback TTS service supports speech output.
