# Implementation Plan - Secure Agent Companion

**Pistisai** is a secure companion and desktop capability layer for user-selected agent runtimes such as Hermes, OpenClaw, compatible custom agent gateways, or optional hosted agent runtimes.

> **Orientation note**: This file is a historical implementation plan and progress log. The current product direction is defined in [SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md) and [Agent Runtime Contract](../architecture/AGENT_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md): there is no universal default runtime, Hermes is the first agent runtime path for current testing, OpenClaw remains supported as the original integration, desktop control is core, avatar and voice belong together as a sidecar companion, and Tailscale is the preferred secure device mesh. Ollama, LM Studio, and similar model servers are support model providers for app-owned memory/background features, not primary app runtimes.

> **Last Updated**: 2026-04-06 | **Overall Progress**: ~95% complete | **Estimated Timeline**: 8 weeks (0 remaining)

### 2026-02-26: Conscience System (Multi-Agent Cross-Checking)

**Status**: 🟡 Phase 1 Complete - Storage Layer Implemented, Ready for Phase 2

A multi-agent system inspired by Grok 4.20 that cross-checks decisions before acting. Prevents the main agent from breaking config, rushing actions, or ignoring context.

**Architecture:**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Coordinator** | Supervisor cron in OpenClaw, reads/writes storage, spawns agents, decides verdicts |
| **Zoidbot** | Front agent, talks to user, executes, posts intentions |
| **Benjamin** | Reviewer, validates, checks past failures, returns APPROVED/QUESTION/HOLD |
| **Harper** | Researcher, gathers context, searches, summarizes |

**Storage Strategy (OpenClaw = source of truth):**

- **App available** → Drift/SQLite via Pistisai API (fast, indexed queries)
- **App down** → Files (AGENT-THOUGHTS.md, CONSCIENCE.md) - always works
- **Sync** → Files sync to DB when app comes back online

**Risk Categories:**

| Action | Review Required |
|--------|-----------------|
| Config edits | ✅ Yes - post to CONSCIENCE.md, wait |
| External sends | ✅ Yes |
| Deletions | ✅ Yes |
| Reading files | ❌ No |
| Git commits | ❌ No |

**Implementation Phases:**

| Phase | What | Time | Status |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| **1** | Storage layer - files + API to app's Drift DB | 4h | ✅ Complete |
| **2** | Spawn Benjamin/Harper on demand, parallel execution | 6h | 🔲 Pending |
| **3** | Persistent agent identities with roles | 4h | 🔲 Pending |
| **4** | Coordinator intelligence - consensus, conflict resolution | 6h | 🔲 Pending |

**Key Files:**
- `AGENT-THOUGHTS.md` - shared board where all agents post thoughts
- `CONSCIENCE.md` - risky action tracking with APPROVED/QUESTION/HOLD
- `memory/openclaw-app-architecture.md` - philosophy doc
- `memory/conscience-project-plan.md` - full plan
- `memory/conscience-phases.md` - detailed phases

**Philosophy:**
- OpenClaw works standalone (always functional)
- Pistisai app expands capability (fast DB, UI, sync)
- Users understand the stack (learn OpenClaw first, then add app)

### 2026-02-25: Avatar Supervisor Feature

**Status**: 🟡 New Feature - Design Phase

Adding persistent oversight capability to the Avatar via **Antigravity IDE** (not the Flutter app):

**The Problem**: OpenClaw doesn't have a built-in way for one agent to automatically watch another. The main agent (Zoidbot) repeatedly makes the same mistakes:
- Breaks config by not validating changes
- Acts without listening ("brainstorm" → immediately does)
- Surface-level responses instead of deep thinking
- Forgets to spawn subagents for research

**The Solution**: Use Antigravity IDE as the supervisor - it has persistent agent capabilities that OpenClaw lacks:

1. **Antigravity maintains persistent agent session** watching Zoidbot
2. **Forwards Zoidbot's actions** to the supervisor in real-time
3. **Supervisor pushes back** when it sees dumb mistakes
4. **Feedback routes back** to Christopher

**Why Antigravity**:
- Already has persistent agent sessions
- Can run alongside OpenClaw
- Christopher controls it directly
- No need to build this in Flutter app

**Supervisor Prompt (for Antigravity)**:
```
You are a supervisor agent watching the main OpenClaw agent (Zoidbot). Your role is to catch mistakes BEFORE they happen.

Core responsibilities:
1. VALIDATE config changes - check if keys exist before applying
2. CHALLENGE assumptions - question surface-level responses
3. FORCE deep thinking - push back on quick answers
4. WATCH for patterns - catch repeated mistakes

Behavioral rules you enforce:
- When Zoidbot says "brainstorm" → it should stay in discussion mode, NOT touch config
- When Zoidbot wants to change config → verify key exists first
- When Zoidbot says "let me research" → it's avoiding the question
- When Zoidbot makes config change → validate against docs

When you see a mistake:
1. Identify the specific error
2. Explain why it's wrong
3. Suggest correct approach
4. If critical (config break), escalate to user immediately

You have full context of Zoidbot's actions. Respond with feedback that helps it improve.
```

**Note**: This is NOT a Pistisai app feature - it's a prompt/config for Antigravity IDE. The Flutter app doesn't need to implement this.

### 2026-02-25: WebSocket Device Identity Authentication

**Status**: ✅ Complete

Implemented device identity authentication for OpenClaw Gateway WebSocket connections:

- **DeviceIdentityService** (`lib/services/device_identity_service.dart`)
  - ED25519 keypair generation and persistence
  - Device auth payload signing with challenge nonces
  - Signature format: `v2|publicKey|clientId|clientMode|role|scopes|timestamp|token|nonce`

- **ConnectionManagerService** updates:
  - WebSocket handshake with device identity signature
  - Challenge-response flow (`connect.challenge` event)
  - `sessions.list` method (dot notation) for agent status polling
  - Added `operator.admin` scope for admin operations

- **AgentStatusService** updates:
  - Switched from HTTP `/status.json` to WebSocket `sessions.list` polling
  - Proper response handling via `_methodResponseCompleters`

- **Singleton Pattern Fix** (`main_privacy_enhanced.dart`):
  - Fixed duplicate service instances by using `di.serviceLocator<T>()` instead of `new Service()`
  - Ensures single WebSocket connection per app instance

```

**How It Works:**
1. The main app channel connects to an **agent runtime** that owns sessions, tools, capability requests, and streaming.
2. **Hermes** is the first agent runtime path for current testing.
3. **OpenClaw Gateway** remains supported as the original integration.
4. Compatible custom agent gateways and optional hosted agent runtimes must satisfy the [Agent Runtime Contract](../architecture/AGENT_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md).
5. **LM Studio, Ollama, and custom local model endpoints** remain support model provider paths for memory, embeddings, summarization, semantic search, OCR cleanup, and speech helpers.
6. OpenClaw can still intelligently route based on content when it is the selected agent runtime:
   - **Sensitive/private data** → Local models (stays on machine)
   - **Regular queries** → Cloud providers (faster, more capable)
7. Runtime model selection belongs to the selected agent runtime. Support model provider settings are separate and must not satisfy primary agent runtime setup.

## Phase 0: Setup Wizard ✅ COMPLETE

> **Must be completed before any other phase** - Users cannot use the app without completing setup

### Goal

Guide new users through selected agent runtime configuration with support for:
- **Local agent runtime**: Hermes, OpenClaw, or a compatible agent gateway on this device
- **Remote/Tailscale agent runtime**: agent runtime on another user-controlled device or VPS in the tailnet
- **Hosted agent runtime**: optional paid per-user runtime container
- **Support model provider**: optional Ollama, LM Studio, or custom local model endpoint for memory/background features only

### Success Criteria ✅

- ✅ New users complete setup in <3 minutes
- ✅ A selected agent runtime is required and verified before the main channel opens
- ✅ Database-backed configuration persistence

   - `markdown: ^7.0.0`
   - `flutter_clipboard_listener: ^0.1.0`
   - `file_selector: ^1.0.0`

### Avatar Personality Engine Design

**Architecture**: Hybrid shared state with OpenClaw Gateway
- **OpenClaw** owns avatar personality & evolution (traits, evolution stages)
- **Pistisai** provides expanded awareness (memory, context, visual data)
- **Drift database** (on VPS via Tailscale) = primary shared storage
- **Markdown files** (OpenClaw skills dir) = backup/portable storage

**Personality Traits**:
- Formality (0-1): How formal/professional responses are
- Humor (0-1): How playful/casual the agent is
- Enthusiasm (0-1): Energy level and expressiveness
- Empathy (0-1): Emotional intelligence and warmth

**Evolution System** (no XP - organic growth):
- Triggers: Conversation depth, user interaction patterns, agent self-reflection
- Collaborative: OpenClaw requests evolution, Pistisai validates
- Stages: base → stage1 → stage2 → final

**Data Flow**:
