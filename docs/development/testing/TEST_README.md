# Pistisai v10.1.147 Authentication Loop Analysis Tests

## 🎯 Overview

This test suite uses Playwright to perform comprehensive end-to-end analysis of the authentication login loop issue in Pistisai v10.1.147. The tests are specifically designed to verify that the race condition fix implemented in this version is working correctly in production environments.

## 🔧 What the Tests Do

### Primary Objectives

1. **Detect Login Loops**: Identify infinite redirect cycles between `/login` and `/callback`
2. **Verify Race Condition Fix**: Confirm the 100ms delay implementation is working
3. **Monitor Authentication Flow**: Track complete auth process from login to success
4. **Capture Debug Information**: Record console logs, network requests, and timing data
5. **Generate Comprehensive Reports**: Provide detailed analysis of authentication behavior

### Specific Checks

- ✅ No infinite redirects (max 10 redirects before flagging as loop)
- ✅ Callback processing takes >100ms (verifying our delay fix)
- ✅ Authentication state properly synchronized before navigation
- ✅ Debug messages present in console logs
- ✅ JWT API calls successful
- ✅ User successfully lands on home page after authentication

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed
- Access to deployed Pistisai v10.1.147 application
- Optional: JWT test credentials for full flow testing

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Install system dependencies (Linux/macOS)
npx playwright install-deps
```

### Running Tests

#### Using PowerShell Script (Recommended)

```powershell
# Basic test (without JWT credentials)
.\run-auth-loop-test.ps1 -DeploymentUrl "https://your-app.vercel.app"

# Full test with JWT credentials
.\run-auth-loop-test.ps1 -DeploymentUrl "https://your-app.vercel.app" -JWTTestEmail "test@example.com" -JWTTestPassword "password123"

# Debug mode (opens browser, slower execution)
.\run-auth-loop-test.ps1 -DeploymentUrl "https://your-app.vercel.app" -Debug

# Install dependencies automatically
.\run-auth-loop-test.ps1 -DeploymentUrl "https://your-app.vercel.app" -InstallDependencies
```

#### Using npm Scripts

```bash
# Set environment variables
export DEPLOYMENT_URL="https://your-app.vercel.app"
export JWT_TEST_EMAIL="test@example.com"  # Optional
export JWT_TEST_PASSWORD="password123"    # Optional

# Run tests
npm run test:auth-loop          # Headless mode
npm run test:auth-loop:headed   # With browser UI
npm run test:auth-loop:debug    # Debug mode with step-by-step execution
```

#### Direct Playwright Commands

```bash
# Run specific test
npx playwright test auth-loop-analysis.spec.js

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test auth-loop-analysis.spec.js --project=chromium-auth-analysis

# Generate and view report
npx playwright test auth-loop-analysis.spec.js --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

### Understanding Results

#### Success Indicators

```
✅ Result: SUCCESS
✅ Total redirects: 2-4 (normal flow)
✅ Callback processing time: >100ms
✅ Debug logs captured: Multiple entries
✅ Final URL: Home page (not /login)
```

#### Failure Indicators

```
❌ Result: INFINITE_LOOP_DETECTED
❌ Total redirects: >10
❌ Result: LOGIN_CALLBACK_LOOP_DETECTED
❌ Result: CALLBACK_STUCK
```

## 🔍 Debugging Authentication Issues

### Console Log Analysis

Look for these debug messages in the test output:

```
🔐 [Callback] Authentication successful, redirecting to home
🔄 [Router] Auth state: true, App subdomain: true
🔄 [Router] Allowing access to protected route
```

### Network Request Analysis

Monitor these key requests:

- JWT authorization endpoint calls
- Token exchange requests (`/oauth/token`)
- User profile requests (`/userinfo`)
- Application callback handling

### Timing Analysis

- **Auth Start to Callback**: Should be <15 seconds
- **Callback Processing**: Should be >100ms (our fix delay)
- **Total Authentication**: Should be <30 seconds

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
DEPLOYMENT_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Optional (for full JWT flow testing)
JWT_TEST_EMAIL=test@example.com
JWT_TEST_PASSWORD=password123

# Test configuration
LOCAL_TEST=false              # Set to true for local build testing
CI=false                      # Set to true in CI environments
```

### Browser Configuration

Tests run on multiple browsers by default:

- **chromium-auth-analysis**: Chrome/Chromium
- **firefox-auth-analysis**: Firefox
- **webkit-auth-analysis**: Safari/WebKit
- **mobile-chrome-auth**: Mobile Chrome simulation
- **mobile-safari-auth**: Mobile Safari simulation

## 🚨 Known Issues and Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

1. **"Deployment not accessible"**
   - Verify the deployment URL is correct and accessible
   - Check if the application is properly deployed
   - Ensure no firewall or network restrictions

2. **"JWT form interaction failed"**
   - Verify JWT test credentials are correct
   - Check if JWT application is properly configured
   - Ensure callback URLs are set correctly in JWT

3. **"Infinite loop detected"**
   - This indicates the race condition fix is NOT working
   - Check if the correct version (10.1.147) is deployed
   - Review JWT configuration for callback URLs

4. **"Callback processing too fast"**
   - Indicates the 100ms delay might not be implemented
   - Verify the build includes the authentication fixes
   - Check if the correct version is deployed

### Debug Mode

Run tests in debug mode for step-by-step analysis:

```bash
npx playwright test auth-loop-analysis.spec.js --debug
```

This will:

- Open browser with developer tools
- Pause at each step for manual inspection
- Allow interaction with the page
- Show detailed execution flow

## 📋 Test Scenarios Covered
