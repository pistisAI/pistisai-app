# Tunnel End-to-End Test Scenarios

> **Status**: Legacy/fallback test scenarios for the older SSH WebSocket tunnel path. New end-to-end connectivity tests should prioritize the Tailscale secure device mesh, agent runtime setup wizard, and per-user cloud connector behavior.

This document outlines the complete user flows that need to be tested for the SSH WebSocket tunnel enhancement.

## Test Scenario 1: User Login and Tunnel Connection Establishment

**Objective:** Verify that users can log in via Auth0 and establish a tunnel connection.

**Steps:**

1. User launches the application
2. User clicks "Login" button
3. Auth0 OAuth flow is initiated
4. User enters credentials and authenticates
5. Application receives JWT token
6. TunnelService is initialized with auth token
7. TunnelService connects to streaming-proxy server
8. WebSocket connection is established
9. SSH tunnel is created to local server

**Expected Results:**

- User is authenticated successfully
- JWT token is stored securely
- WebSocket connection shows "Connected" status
- Tunnel health metrics show active connection
- No errors in logs

**Requirements Verified:**

- Requirement 1: Connection Resilience (connection establishment)
- Requirement 4: Multi-Tenant Security (JWT validation)
- Requirement 6: WebSocket Connection Management (connection establishment)

2. User sends an Ollama API request (e.g., GET /api/tags)
3. Request is queued in PersistentRequestQueue
4. Request is forwarded through WebSocket to streaming-proxy
5. streaming-proxy validates request with RateLimiter
6. streaming-proxy forwards request through SSH tunnel
7. Local Ollama server processes request
8. Response is sent back through tunnel
9. Response is delivered to client
10. Metrics are recorded

**Expected Results:**

- Request is successfully forwarded
- Response is received with correct status code

6. Network is restored
7. TunnelService reconnects to streaming-proxy
8. WebSocket connection is re-established

10. Queued requests are flushed
11. Metrics are updated

**Expected Results:**

## Test Scenario 4: Error Scenarios

### 4b: Network Failure (Server Unreachable)

**Steps:**

1. User attempts to connect to unreachable server
2. Connection attempt times out
3. Error is caught and categorized

**Expected Results:**

- Connection fails with clear error message
- Error suggests checking network/firewall
- Automatic reconnection is triggered
- Error is logged

**Requirements Verified:**

- Requirement 1: Connection Resilience (error recovery)
- Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Handling (error categorization)

### 4c: Server Error (streaming-proxy returns 500)

**Steps:**

1. User sends request while server is experiencing error
2. streaming-proxy returns 500 error
3. CircuitBreaker detects failure
4. Request is retried or queued

**Expected Results:**

- Error is caught and handled gracefully
- CircuitBreaker enters OPEN state after threshold
- Requests are queued during outage
- CircuitBreaker recovers after timeout
- User sees appropriate error message

**Requirements Verified:**

- Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Handling (error recovery)
- Requirement 5: Request Queuing (backpressure)

### 4d: Rate Limit Exceeded

**Steps:**

1. User sends requests exceeding rate limit (>100 req/min)
2. RateLimiter detects violation
3. Request is rejected with 429 Too Many Requests

**Expected Results:**

- Request is rejected with 429 status
- Error message indicates rate limit exceeded
- Retry-After header is provided
- Metrics record rate limit violation
- User is notified

**Requirements Verified:**

- Requirement 3: Performance Monitoring (rate limit metrics)
- Requirement 4: Multi-Tenant Security (rate limiting)

## Test Scenario 5: Configuration Changes

**Objective:** Verify that configuration changes are applied correctly.

**Steps:**
