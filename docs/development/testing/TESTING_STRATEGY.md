# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy to improve test coverage and reliability for the CloudToLocalLLM project. Currently, the project lacks comprehensive E2E tests and has minimal backend unit test coverage.

## Goals

1. **Reliability:** Ensure core user flows (Login, Chat, Settings) work reliably across updates.
2. **Safety:** Prevent regressions in backend logic (Auth, Admin, Tunnels).
3. **Verification:** Automatically verify feature flags and platform-specific toggles where possible.

## E2E Testing (Priority: High)

**Tool:** Playwright
**Target:** Web Application (Flutter Web)

### Key Scenarios

1. **Smoke Test:**
    * Load application URL.
    * Verify title and initial landing page render.
2. **Authentication:**
    * Perform Mock Login (bypass Auth0 UI if possible, or use test credentials).
    * Verify redirection to Dashboard/Chat.
3. **Settings:**
    * Navigate to Settings page.
    * Verify toggle states (e.g., Theme, Window Manager settings).
4. **Chat:**
    * Send a test message.
    * Verify response (mocked LLM response).

**Action Item:** See GitHub Issue #44 "CICD-013: Playwright E2E Smoke (Web)".

## Unit Testing (Priority: High)

**Tool:** Jest
**Target:** Node.js Backend Services (`services/api-backend`, `services/streaming-proxy`)

### Key Areas

1. **AuthService:**
    * Token validation logic.
    * User role assignment.
2. **AdminCenterService:**
    * Permission checks.
    * User suspension/reactivation logic.
3. **AlertingService:**
    * Verify alert dispatch logic (mocking transports).
4. **PoolMonitor:**
    * Connection health logic.

**Action Item:** See GitHub Issue #175 "Implement Backend Unit Tests".

## Feature Verification (Priority: Medium)

**Method:** Manual / Scripted
**Target:** Completed 15 TODO items (Window Manager, etc.)

Since some features (Window Manager, System Tray) are hard to test in headless CI, manual verification checklists will be used initially.

**Action Item:** See GitHub Issue #176 "Verify Recent Feature Implementations".

## CI/CD Integration

* **Unit Tests:** Run on every PR.
* **E2E Tests:** Run on every PR to `main` and before release.
