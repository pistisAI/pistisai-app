# Admin Center API Documentation - Complete Reference

## Overview

The Admin Center API provides secure administrative endpoints for managing CloudToLocalLLM users, subscriptions, payments, and system operations. All endpoints require admin authentication with role-based permissions.

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** November 2025

## Base URL

```
Production: https://api.pistisai.app/api/admin
Staging: https://staging-api.pistisai.app/api/admin
Development: http://localhost:3001/api/admin
```

## Authentication

All admin endpoints require a valid JWT token with admin privileges.

### Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Admin Roles and Permissions

The Admin Center implements role-based access control (RBAC) with three distinct roles:

#### Super Admin

**Full access to all admin operations**

Permissions:

- All user management operations (view, edit, suspend, delete)
- All payment operations (view, process refunds)
- All subscription operations (view, edit, cancel)
- All reporting operations (view, export)
- Admin management (create, edit, delete admins)
- Configuration management
- Audit log access (view, export)

#### Support Admin

**User support and account management**

Permissions:

- View users
- Edit users (subscription changes)
- Suspend/reactivate users
- View sessions
- Terminate sessions
- View payments (read-only)
- View audit logs (read-only)

#### Finance Admin

**Financial operations and reporting**

Permissions:

- View users (read-only)
- View payments
- Process refunds
- View subscriptions

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in to main application via Auth0
2. JWT token issued with user claims
3. Admin role verified from `admin_roles` table
4. Token passed to Admin Center via session inheritance
5. Each API request validates token and checks permissions

## Rate Limiting

Admin API endpoints implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure system stability.

| Endpoint Type | Requests/Minute | Burst Allowance | Window |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Standard Operations | 100 | 20 | 60 seconds |
| Expensive Operations | 20 | 5 | 60 seconds |
| Report Generation | 10 | 2 | 60 seconds |
| Export Operations | 5 | 1 | 60 seconds |

### Rate Limit Headers

All responses include rate limit information:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1705843260
X-RateLimit-Window: 60
```
