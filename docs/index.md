# Pistisai

**A local-first companion and desktop capability layer for agent runtimes.**

Pistisai is a Flutter desktop/web application with optional Node.js backend services. It provides a secure agent channel, avatar/voice companion, desktop control, vision system, agent runtime management, and multi-device sync through a Tailscale-first secure device mesh.

## What It Does

- **Secure Agent Channel** — Connects to your chosen agent runtime (Hermes, OpenClaw, or a compatible custom gateway). The setup wizard selects the runtime — no universal default.
- **Avatar & Voice Companion** — Persistent personality, evolution state, long-term memory, visual presence, and voice conversation in a sidecar window.
- **Desktop Control** — Explicit, device-scoped, permissioned, and auditable desktop inspection and operation.
- **Vision System** — Screenshots, region capture, camera input, and OCR for visual context.
- **Secure Device Mesh** — Tailscale-first private connectivity across devices, with optional cloud connector containers joined to your tailnet.
- **Multi-Runtime** — Agent runtime management for Hermes, OpenClaw, and compatible custom gateways.
