# Future Enhancements

This document tracks potential future enhancements and technology considerations for Pistisai.

## Self-Hosted Backend Infrastructure

### Convex Integration (Priority: Future)

**Package**: `convex_flutter: ^0.1.11`
**Documentation**: https://docs.convex.dev
**Repository**: https://github.com/get-convex/convex

**Overview**: Convex is a full-stack backend-as-a-service that can be self-hosted, providing an alternative to cloud-dependent services like Auth0 and Firebase.

**Capabilities**:
- **Authentication**: Built-in user auth with email/password, OAuth providers
- **Real-time Database**: Automatically synced, queryable document store with reactive queries
- **Serverless Functions**: Run backend logic in Convex's JavaScript runtime
- **File Storage**: Built-in file uploads with automatic CDN delivery
- **Self-Hosting**: Full control over data infrastructure

**Potential Use Cases for Pistisai**:

1. **Replace Auth0** - Privacy-first self-hosted authentication
   - Complete data ownership for user accounts
   - No third-party auth dependency
   - Reduced operational costs

2. **Avatar Personality Sync** - Real-time cross-device synchronization
   - Personality traits evolution synced across user devices
   - Conversation depth tracking with automatic offline-to-online sync
   - Achievement unlocking with immediate UI updates

3. **Conversation History** - Enhanced local brain with real-time sync
   - Offline-first conversations with background sync
   - Multi-device conversation continuity
   - Efficient vector embeddings storage and retrieval

4. **File Storage** - Avatar assets and voice recordings
   - Avatar appearance customization with asset versioning
   - Voice interaction audio storage
   - User-generated content management

**Migration Considerations**:

| Current Service | Convex Alternative | Migration Effort |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Auth0 (JWT auth) | Convex Auth | Medium - requires user data migration |
| PostgreSQL (server) | Convex Database | High - schema redesign needed |
| LocalBrain (SQLite) | Convex + Local caching | High - sync architecture redesign |
| Cloud file storage | Convex File Storage | Low - API similarity |

**Pros**:
- ✅ Self-hosted for complete data control
- ✅ Unified backend stack reduces complexity
- ✅ Real-time sync built-in
- ✅ Offline-first architecture support
- ✅ TypeScript for backend logic (shares language with backend services)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Relatively new platform (smaller ecosystem)
- ❌ Self-hosting requires additional infrastructure
- ❌ Migration effort from existing stack
- ❌ Learning curve for team

**Implementation Notes**:
```yaml
# Add to pubspec.yaml when ready to implement
dependencies:
  convex_flutter: ^0.1.11
```

```dart
// Example: Initialize Convex for self-hosted auth
import 'package:convex_flutter/convex_flutter.dart';

final convex = Convex(
  address: 'your-self-hosted-convex-instance.convex.cloud',
);

// Replace Auth0 authentication
Future<User> signIn(String email, String password) async {
  return await convex.auth.signIn(email, password);
}
```

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Prototype Convex in a separate branch with basic auth flow
2. Evaluate sync performance for conversation history
3. Test self-hosting deployment on existing infrastructure
4. Conduct cost-benefit analysis vs. current Auth0 + PostgreSQL setup

## Other Future Enhancements

### Desktop Control & Automation (Pillar 4)

**Current Status**: Partial (`GuiAutomationService` exists)

**Planned Features**:
- Window management (resize, move, minimize/maximize)
- Clipboard synchronization across devices
- File system automation (watch, copy, move)
- Cross-platform desktop shortcuts/macros

**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Vision System (Pillar 5)

**Current Status**: Partial (screen capture via `GuiAutomationService`)

**Planned Features**:
- Camera input for physical world interaction
- OCR capabilities for text extraction from screen
- Continuous monitoring with configurable triggers
- Region-specific screen analysis

**Estimated Effort**: Medium-High

### Avatar Memory System

**Current Status**: Phase 1 complete (PersonalityEngine + EvolutionTracker)

**Planned Features**:
- Conversation embeddings for semantic search
- Long-term memory with importance scoring
- Context-aware memory retrieval
- Memory consolidation and pruning

**Estimated Effort**: High
