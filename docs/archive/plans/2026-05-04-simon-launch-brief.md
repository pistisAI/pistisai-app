# Pistisai — Release + Money Plan (Simon Brief)

**Purpose:** Get Pistisai into a viable testable release fast, then convert that into early pilot revenue.

## 1) What we are shipping first

A **Linux-first early-access version** of Pistisai that is good enough for real testers to install, connect, use, and trust.

### First release must do these well
- **Main cockpit timeline**
  - one channel of truth
  - chat + background work + runtime state together
- **Setup that does not suck**
  - first-run wizard
  - reconnect/reopen setup works
- **Runtime connection clarity**
  - easy to understand what is connected
  - easy to recover when broken
- **Visible background work**
  - users can see what the system is doing
- **Voice companion that feels good enough to demo**
  - fast, calm, useful
- **Explicit camera/vision state**
  - obvious when it is on, why it is on, and what it can do
- **Reliable continuity**
  - restarts/recovery do not make the app feel brain-dead

## 2) What we are NOT trying to finish before launch
- full multi-device sync
- broad Windows polish
- hosted-runtime complexity
- deep architecture cleanup
- every future feature

That stuff can come after the product is already testable and near-paying.

## 3) Current status

Pistisai is already close enough that this is now a **launch-discipline problem**, not an idea problem.

### Verified now
- core product docs exist
- cockpit/timeline work exists in repo
- setup wizard work exists in repo
- voice direction exists in repo
- packaging/release workflows exist in repo
- targeted tests are passing
- targeted analysis is passing
- Linux debug build succeeds

## 4) The actual release goal

**Goal:** within 4 weeks, have a version that can be put in front of testers without embarrassment.

### Release standard
A tester should be able to:
1. install it
2. connect a runtime
3. talk to it
4. see what it is doing
5. recover from interruption/restart
6. understand voice/camera state
7. finish the session wanting to use it again

If it cannot do that, it is still pre-release.

## 5) 4-week timeline

## Week 1 — Lock the launch wedge
**Outcome:** stop widening scope and harden the minimum release path.

### Must finish
- freeze first-release scope
- make main cockpit the primary product surface
- harden setup/reconnect/reopen setup
- create release-readiness checklist

### Definition of done
- one documented launch scope
- one clear primary UX surface
- setup failure/recovery paths tested

## Week 2 — Make the demo slap
**Outcome:** the app feels real, not like scaffolding.

### Must finish
- tighten voice loop
- clarify camera/vision permissions and states
- define one internal demo flow that works every time

### Definition of done
- voice is demoable
- camera/vision state is explicit
- one “holy shit” demo path is repeatable

## Week 3 — Release path + tester onboarding
**Outcome:** a real tester can get in.

### Must finish
- verify Linux packaging/install flow
- verify installer/release artifacts
- create quick-start + known-limits + feedback docs
- simplify landing/pricing language

### Definition of done
- a tester can install without live babysitting
- docs cover setup, limits, and feedback

## Week 4 — Pilot conversion
**Outcome:** move from testing to first money.

### Must finish
- onboard 3–5 serious testers
- gather repeat-use signal
- ask for paid pilot commitment

### Definition of done
- at least 3 real users tried it
- at least 2 used it more than once
- at least 1 is willing to discuss paying

## 6) Business plan

## First business model
Do **not** overcomplicate the offer.

Start with a simple early-access/pilot model.

### Option A — Lean early pilot
- **$99/month**
- best for founders/operators already willing to run local-first setup

### Option B — Mixed offer
- **$49/month local-first personal tier**
- **$149/month business/operator tier**
- better if we want a wider test funnel without killing business upside

### Option C — Hosted/white-glove later
- **$249/month+**
- only after the local-first product is sticky

## Revenue scenarios

### Lean pilot
- 5 pilots @ $99 = **$495 MRR**
- 10 pilots @ $99 = **$990 MRR**
- 15 pilots @ $99 = **$1,485 MRR**

### Mixed offer
- 5 local-first @ $49 + 3 business @ $149 = **$692 MRR**
- 10 local-first @ $49 + 5 business @ $149 = **$1,235 MRR**
- 20 local-first @ $49 + 8 business @ $149 = **$2,172 MRR**

### Hosted-plus later
- 3 hosted @ $249 + 5 local-first @ $49 = **$992 MRR**
- 5 hosted @ $249 + 10 local-first @ $49 = **$1,735 MRR**

## Expense assumptions for first pilot stage
These are rough planning assumptions, not final accounting.

### Lean base
- VPS/control plane: **$60/mo**
- email/domain/misc: **$40/mo**
- release/monitoring buffer: **$50/mo**
- **Total: $150/mo**

### Mixed base
- VPS/control plane: **$80/mo**
- email/domain/misc: **$40/mo**
- support/demo buffer: **$80/mo**
- **Total: $200/mo**

### Important reality
The biggest early cost is **support time and scope sprawl**, not infrastructure.

## 7) Who should test first
Not random curious people.

Best early testers:
- overloaded operators
- founders
- people drowning in messages/admin/context
- people who can feel friction reduction quickly
- people who will actually tell us if it is worth paying for

## 8) What we need from Simon

Not generic encouragement.

We need Simon to react to this like a product/operator:
- is this something he would actually use?
- which part is most valuable first?
- what would make it good enough to use weekly?
- what would make it worth paying for?
- what would stop him from trusting it?

## 9) Immediate priorities

### Priority 1
Ship the smallest release that feels coherent and trustworthy.

### Priority 2
Make the voice/cockpit experience strong enough that people “get it” quickly.

### Priority 3
Prove installation, setup, and recovery are not painful.

### Priority 4
Turn early tester use into paid pilot conversations fast.

## 10) Blunt conclusion

Pistisai is close.

The next step is **not more broad ideation**.
The next step is:
- lock scope
- harden the launch wedge
- release Linux early access
- test with serious users
- convert that into pilot revenue quickly

That is the plan.
