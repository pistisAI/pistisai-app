# macOS Installation Guide

macOS support is planned but not the primary packaged desktop target yet. This guide covers the current development build path and the intended setup direction.

Agent runtime selection belongs to the setup wizard. Pistisai can connect to Hermes, OpenClaw, or a compatible custom agent gateway. Hermes is the first agent runtime path for current testing.

Ollama and LM Studio are optional support model providers for memory/background features, not primary app runtimes.

---

## Current Status

The macOS app is expected to support:

- Native app bundle packaging
- Menu bar integration
- Notifications
- Keychain storage for secrets
- Tailscale-backed remote agent runtime access
- Desktop, screen, and accessibility permissions where macOS allows them

Packaged macOS distribution details are still pending. Avoid documenting dated release windows until the release process is active.

## Development Build

### Prerequisites

- macOS 12 or later recommended
- Xcode from the App Store
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Flutter SDK
- CocoaPods
- Git

Install common prerequisites:

```bash
xcode-select --install
sudo gem install cocoapods
flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
```

### Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pistisAI/pistisai-app.git
cd Pistisai
flutter pub get
flutter build macos --release
```

The built app is under:

```text
build/macos/Build/Products/Release/
```

## Agent Runtime Prerequisites

Prepare one agent runtime before or during first launch:

| Runtime | Typical Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hermes | Configured in wizard | First agent runtime path for current testing |
| OpenClaw Gateway | `http://localhost:18789` | Supported original integration |
| Custom agent gateway | User supplied | Private server, VPS, or compatible agent runtime API |
| Hosted agent runtime | Pistisai managed | Optional paid compute |

For a runtime on another machine, install Tailscale on both devices and confirm they can reach each other:

```bash
tailscale status
tailscale ping <runtime-device-name>
```

## Optional Support Model Provider

| Provider | Typical Endpoint | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LM Studio | `http://localhost:1234` | Local model support for app features |
| Ollama | `http://localhost:11434` | Local model support for memory/background features |

---

## First Launch

1. Start your selected agent runtime or confirm the remote runtime is reachable.
2. Launch the macOS development build.
3. Complete the setup wizard.
4. Select the agent runtime and endpoint.
5. Optionally configure a support model provider for memory/background features.
6. Grant macOS permissions only for features you need.
7. Enable Tailscale-backed sync if using remote devices.

### macOS Permissions

Desktop-control features may require:

- Accessibility
- Screen Recording
- Microphone for voice input
- Camera for vision input
- Files and folders access for explicit file operations

These permissions are granted on the local Mac only. Syncing an account does not automatically grant control over other devices.

---

## Planned Installation Methods

### App Bundle

1. Download a signed `.dmg` or `.zip` release when available.
2. Move Pistisai to Applications.
3. Launch from Applications or Spotlight.
4. Complete the setup wizard.

### Homebrew

Homebrew distribution is planned after packaging is stable.

```bash
brew tap pistisAI/pistisai-app
brew install pistisai
```

---

## Web And Cloud Access

Web and mobile access should use the Tailscale-first cloud connector design. The connector is an isolated per-user container joined to the user's tailnet after approval. It coordinates reachability and sync, but it does not automatically grant desktop-control permissions.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Runtime Not Found

- Confirm the selected agent runtime is running.
- Check the endpoint configured in the wizard.
- Test the runtime health endpoint if it has one.
- For remote runtimes, confirm Tailscale connectivity.
- Confirm you did not enter an Ollama/LM Studio endpoint as the agent runtime.

### Support Model Provider Not Found

- Confirm Ollama, LM Studio, or the custom local model endpoint is running.
- Check support model provider settings.
- Test the model endpoint directly.

### Desktop Control Not Working

- Open System Settings.
- Review Privacy & Security permissions.
- Confirm Accessibility and Screen Recording are granted to Pistisai.
- Restart the app after permission changes.

### Build Fails

```bash
flutter doctor
pod repo update
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

Then rebuild.
