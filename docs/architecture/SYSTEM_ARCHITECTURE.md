# Pistisai System Architecture

Pistisai is a Flutter desktop/web application with optional Node.js backend services. It is a local-first companion and desktop capability layer for user-selected agent runtimes such as Hermes, OpenClaw, and compatible custom agent gateways.

Ollama, LM Studio, and similar local model servers are support model providers. They can power memory, embeddings, summarization, semantic search, OCR cleanup, speech helpers, and other app-owned background intelligence, but they are not primary app runtimes.

Core functionality is local-first. Cloud services add authentication, sync, presence, admin, per-user cloud connector containers, and optional hosted agent runtime compute. They should not be required for the single-device local path.

The setup wizard is the authority for agent runtime selection. Do not assume one universal default runtime. Hermes is the current first test path; OpenClaw remains a supported agent runtime and original integration.

## Flutter Structure

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/main.dart` | App entry point |
| `lib/bootstrap/` | Startup/bootstrap support |
| `lib/di/locator.dart` | GetIt service registration and two-phase DI |
| `lib/database/` | Drift database and platform connections |
| `lib/services/` | Service layer |
| `lib/services/providers/` | Support model and router provider adapters |
| `lib/services/avatar/` | Personality, evolution, memory, avatar state |
| `lib/services/voice/` | Avatar companion voice state, Hermes bridge status, TTS foundation |
| `lib/services/openclaw_manager/` | Gateway control |
| `lib/services/hermes_manager/` | Hermes gateway and streaming management |
| `lib/services/desktop_control/` | Clipboard and desktop window control |
| `lib/services/vision/` | Region capture, camera capture, OCR, vision orchestration |
| `lib/screens/` | App screens |
| `lib/widgets/` | Shared UI widgets |

## Dependency Injection

`lib/di/locator.dart` owns service registration.

1. `setupCoreServices()` registers pre-auth services: settings, session/auth support, local brain, router, provider discovery, platform detection, setup wizard, and tier services.
2. `setupAuthenticatedServices()` calls core setup first, then registers auth-dependent services: tunnel, streaming proxy, LLM provider manager, LangChain, gateway control, agent lifecycle, admin, desktop control, vision, and popout services.

Use `di.serviceLocator<T>()` or `serviceLocator.get<T>()` for registered services. Do not instantiate long-lived services directly unless the file already follows that pattern for a local helper.

## Pillar Services

### Chat

| Service | File |
| --- | --- |
| `StreamingChatService` | `lib/services/streaming_chat_service.dart` |
| `ConversationStorageService` | `lib/services/conversation_storage_service.dart` |
| `LocalConversationStorage` | `lib/services/local_conversation_storage.dart` |

### Agent Runtime And Session Management

| Service | File |
| --- | --- |
| `ConnectionManagerService` | `lib/services/connection_manager_service.dart` |
| `AgentStatusService` | `lib/services/agent_status_service.dart` |
| `AgentLifecycleService` | `lib/services/agent_lifecycle_service.dart` |
| `GatewayControlService` | `lib/services/openclaw_manager/gateway_control_service.dart` |

Agent runtime discovery should scan Hermes, OpenClaw Gateway on `localhost:18789`, and compatible custom agent gateways.

Local model provider discovery may scan LM Studio on `localhost:1234`, Ollama on `localhost:11434`, and similar model endpoints for memory/background features only.

### Avatar

| Service | File |
| --- | --- |
| `AvatarStateService` | `lib/services/avatar/avatar_state_service.dart` |
| `PersonalityEngine` | `lib/services/avatar/personality_engine.dart` |
| `EvolutionTracker` | `lib/services/avatar/evolution_tracker.dart` |
| `MemoryService` | `lib/services/avatar/memory_service.dart` |
| `MarkdownSyncService` | `lib/services/avatar/markdown_sync_service.dart` |

Voice is part of the avatar companion experience. The main app can show compact avatar/voice status, but the intended UX is a sidecar companion window attached to the secure agent channel.

### Voice Foundation

| Service | File |
| --- | --- |
| `VoiceConversationService` | `lib/services/voice/voice_conversation_service.dart` |
| `HermesVoiceBridgeService` | `lib/services/voice/hermes_voice_bridge_service.dart` |
| `CloudTtsService` | `lib/services/voice/cloud_tts_service.dart` |

### Desktop Control

| Service | File |
| --- | --- |
| `GuiAutomationService` | `lib/services/gui_automation_service.dart` |
| `SystemControlService` | `lib/services/system_control_service.dart` |
| `ClipboardService` | `lib/services/desktop_control/clipboard_service.dart` |
| `WindowManagerService` | `lib/services/desktop_control/window_manager_service.dart` |

### Vision

| Service | File |
| --- | --- |
| `VisionService` | `lib/services/vision/vision_service.dart` |
| `RegionCaptureService` | `lib/services/vision/region_capture_service.dart` |
| `CameraCaptureService` | `lib/services/vision/camera_capture_service.dart` |
| `OcrEngineService` | `lib/services/vision/ocr_engine_service.dart` |

## Embedded Router And Support Providers

The Flutter app embeds an OpenAI-compatible HTTP router for app-owned local services and support-provider integration. This router is not itself the primary agent runtime.

- Implementation: `lib/services/router_server.dart`
- Default port: `1337`
- Health: `GET /health`
- Models: `GET /v1/models`
- Chat: `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- Speech: `POST /v1/audio/speech`
- Voices: `GET /v1/audio/voices`
- Avatar state: `GET /avatar/state`
- Avatar traits: `POST /avatar/traits`
- Avatar evolution request: `POST /avatar/evolution/request`

Current provider adapter files:

| Adapter | File |
| --- | --- |
| Base models/interface | `lib/services/providers/base_provider.dart` |
| Zhipu | `lib/services/providers/zhipu_adapter.dart` |
| Google | `lib/services/providers/google_adapter.dart` |
| Moonshot | `lib/services/providers/moonshot_adapter.dart` |
| Hermes | `lib/services/providers/hermes_adapter.dart` |

Provider configuration and discovery for local support model services are handled separately by `ProviderConfigurationManager`, `ProviderDiscoveryService`, and `LLMProviderManager`.

## Agent Runtime Contract

The main secure channel connects to an agent runtime. See [Agent Runtime Contract](AGENT_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md).

Minimum runtime capabilities include health, session lifecycle, chat streaming, agent status, tool listing, desktop action requests, and vision context requests. Raw local model providers must not satisfy agent runtime setup unless they are wrapped by a compatible agent gateway.

## Data Storage

| Store | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Drift/SQLite | Local brain, conversations, avatar state, memories, rate-limit data |
| IndexedDB/web storage | Web-safe client storage paths |
| PostgreSQL | Optional backend persistence for authenticated cloud features |
| Markdown sync | Avatar/personality backup and OpenClaw skill integration |

## Secure Device Mesh

Tailscale is the preferred private transport for multi-device Pistisai.

```text
Client UI / web / phone
        |
Optional per-user Pistisai cloud connector
        |
User's Tailscale tailnet
        |
Pistisai desktop apps and user-selected agent runtimes
```

The intended cloud connector shape is one isolated container per user. The connector joins only that user's tailnet, coordinates secure channel sync and device presence, and must not bypass local desktop permissions.

Custom SSH/WebSocket tunnel infrastructure should be treated as legacy or fallback unless a task explicitly targets it.

After changing Drift schema or queries, run:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Backend Services

| Service | Directory | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API backend | `services/api-backend/` | Express 5, Auth0 JWT, PostgreSQL, admin routes, tunnel/proxy APIs |
| Streaming proxy | `services/streaming-proxy/` | WebSocket/HTTP proxy container with TypeScript modules under `src/`; legacy/fallback for tunnel-heavy paths |
| Tailscale relay | `services/tailscale-relay/` | Relay service using Express 4 |
| Auth backend | `backend/auth/` | Lightweight CommonJS Auth0 JWT validation |
| SDK | `services/sdk/` | TypeScript SDK published from `dist/` |
| OpenClaw skills | `services/openclaw-skills/cloudtolocallm/` | Avatar personality/evolution skill package |

## Platform Boundaries

The app uses conditional imports for web/native splits. Do not import `dart:io` in shared code.

Examples in the repo use:

- `dart.library.io`
- `dart.library.html`
- `dart.library.js_interop`

Match nearby file patterns when adding platform-specific code.
